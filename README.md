This project focuses on implementing a Next Word Prediction model using TensorFlow and Keras in a Google Colab environment. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict the next word in a sentence, demonstrating the power of deep learning in language modeling.

Next Word Prediction with TensorFlow and Keras
Overview
This project focuses on building a Next Word Prediction model using TensorFlow and Keras within a Google Colab environment. Next Word Prediction is a significant application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that can be used in various text generation tasks.

In this repository, you'll find the Jupyter Notebook (Next_Word_Prediction.ipynb) that contains the code for training the model and predicting the next word in a sequence. By using deep learning techniques and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), this model can generate contextually relevant word predictions based on a given text input.

Key Features
Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning.
Implements a Tokenizer to map words to integers.
Employs LSTM layers for sequence modeling.
Saves the best model using ModelCheckpoint.
Preprocesses and trains the model on text data.
Allows for predictions of the next word in a sequence.
Provides a foundation for language modeling and text generation tasks.
Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started with the Next Word Prediction model:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

Prepare Your Data: You can use your own text data for training the model. Make sure to upload the text data to a Google Colab environment as per the instructions in the notebook.

Training the Model: Open and run the provided Jupyter Notebook (Next_Word_Prediction.ipynb) in your Google Colab environment. This notebook contains the code for training the model. The ModelCheckpoint callback will save the best model during training.

Interact with the Model: After training, you can interact with the model to predict the next word for given sequences. Simply provide input text sequences and observe the model's predictions.

Customization: Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific text generation needs. You can also fine-tune the model with additional data for improved predictions.
